## Boundary matchers
| ^ | The beginning of a line |
| $ | The end of a line |
| \b | A word boundary |
| \B | A non-word boundary |
| \A | The beginning of the input |
| \G | The end of the previous match |

## Greedy quantifiers
| X? | X, once or not at all |

| X+ | X, one or more times |
| X{n} | X, exactly n times |
| X{n,} | X, at least n times |
| X{n,m} | X, at least n but not more than m times |

## Reluctant quantifiers
| X?? | X, once or not at all |
| X*? | X, zero or more times |
| X+? | X, one or more times |
| X{n}? | X, exactly n times |
| X{n,}? | X, at least n times |

## Logical operators
| XY | X followed by Y |
| X|Y | Either X or Y |
| (X) | X, as a capturing group |

Back references
| \n | Whatever the nth capturing group matched |
| \k<name> | Whatever the named-capturing group "name" matched |

Quotation
| \ | Nothing, but quotes the following character |
| \Q | Nothing, but quotes all characters until \E |
| \E | Nothing, but ends quoting started by \Q |

Special constructs (named-capturing and non-capturing)
| (?<name>X) | X, as a named-capturing group |
| (?:X) | X, as a non-capturing group |
| (?idmsuxU-idmsuxU)  | Nothing, but turns match flags i d m s u x U on - off |
| (?idmsux-idmsux:X)   | X, as a non-capturing group with the given flags i d m s u x on - off |
| (?=X) | X, via zero-width positive lookahead |
| (?!X) | X, via zero-width negative lookahead |
| (?<=X) | X, via zero-width positive lookbehind |
| (?<!X) | X, via zero-width negative lookbehind |
| (?>X) | X, as an independent, non-capturing group |
